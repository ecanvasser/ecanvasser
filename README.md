### About Me ðŸ§ 
Howdy, my name is Eddie and I'm an aspiring full-stack developer. I graduated from college as a finance major, stumbled into sales for a while, and then quit my job to learn the ropes of becoming a full-stack developer. All of my learning is self-taught through The Odin Project, which specializes in the MERN stack. You can find all of my work below. Most of my larger projects will be pinned towards the top, but there's also a mixture of smaller repo's that I've used to learn new libraries/technologies.
