### About Me ðŸ§ 
Hello, my name is Eddie and I'm an aspiring full-stack developer. I graduated from college as a finance major, stumbled into sales for a while, and then quit my job to go all-in on software development.

You can find all of my work below. Most of my larger projects will be pinned towards the top, but there's also a mixture of smaller repo's that I've used to learn new libraries/technologies.
